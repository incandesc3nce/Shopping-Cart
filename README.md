# Shopping-Cart

Shopping Cart is a simple application that allows users to browse and add
various items to shopping cart.
It utilizes React, Redux, and React Router for its front-end functionality.
The application features a responsive user interface and a shopping cart where
users can add and remove items. The application also
includes a Redux store for managing the state of the application.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of React,
Redux, and front-end development.
